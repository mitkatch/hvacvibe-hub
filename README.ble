The fix that made it work was editing /etc/bluetooth/main.conf:
ini[Policy]
AutoEnable=true

[General]
JustWorksRepairing = always
Privacy = off
Without this, bluez was sending a pairing/security request during GATT service discovery that the nRF52840 firmware rejected, causing immediate disconnect.
